## 📈 Research Trajectory Recommendations

### For PhD Students

```
Year 1: Choose ONE area, deep dive
        ├── Neuromorphic: Good hardware access (Intel NRC)
        ├── CIM: Simulation-based, interdisciplinary
        ├── Quantum: Long-term bet, high ceiling
        └── Bio-inspired: Novel angles, less competitive

Year 2-3: Publish initial work, identify gap
          Build expertise, collaborations

Year 4-5: Major contribution, thesis
          Establish independent direction
```
